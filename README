Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (fann)

Fast Artificial Neural Network Library implements multilayer
artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected
and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in both
fixed and floating point are supported. It includes a framework for
easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile,
well documented, and fast. Bindings to other programming languages 
and a GUI are also available.

A reference manual accompanies the library with examples and
recommendations on how to use the library.

The reference manual is available at: http://leenissen.dk/fann/html/index.html

A university report about the implementation of version 1.0 is also
