libfann (2.1.0) stable; urgency=low
	* Added fann_create_train_from_callback for creating training data from a callback function
	* Amended fann_create_train_from_callback for dynamic link library compatibility
	* Added fann_get_activation_function and fann_get_activation_steepness matching the set functions
	* Added a set of functions to allow restricted access to neural network layout, connections, and weights.
	* Added FANN_SIN, FANN_COS, FANN_SIN_SYMMETRIC and FANN_COS_SYMMETRIC activation functions
	* Changed the create_array functions to indicate that the layers array parameter is const i.e. input only
	* Added FANN_API calling convention to fann_get_bit_fail and two cascade functions for dll compatibility
	* Added FANN_EXTERNAL/FANN_API calling convention to previous extension functions for dll compatibility
	* Removed warning from fann_print_connections with explicit casts
	* Added fann_set/get_user_data to allow user programs to refer to their own data during callbacks
	* Added documented C++ wrapper and sample C++ program
	* Fixed bias count for shortcut networks in fann_get_layer_array and fann_get_bias_array
	* Minor fixes of FANN_EXTERNAL/FANN_API for windows dll compatibility
	* More advanced scaling functionality
	* Added advanced scaling functionality to fann_cpp.h
	* Additional documentation and fix of FANN_EXTERNAL for create train callback in fann_cpp.h
	* Fixed problems with FANN_GAUSSIAN and FANN_GAUSSIAN_SYMMETRIC activation functions
	* Added semi Widrow + Nguyen to initialization of cascade weights
	* Fixed problem with RPROP, which makes it go suboptimal in the beginning
	* Changed definition of MSE, so that it calculates a value pr output, and not a sum for all outputs. (MSE = MSE/ann->num_output)
	* Added more benchmark data
	* Added possebility to make benchmark as average of several
	* Changed so that RPROP and Quickprop may not alter a weight to more than 1500
